isHughShowering.com
====================

This was a site I ran for my roommate Hugh, who would take hours preparing to go out (showering, brushing his teeth, and so on) while we were trying to coordinate to leave.

A very simple site, but it has a PHP backend that allows an admin to go in and change the toggle- which then sends out an alert to everone on the mailing list.
